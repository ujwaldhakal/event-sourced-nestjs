### Event Sourced Application
It is a simple event sourced system that handles warehouse `ItemAdded`,`ItemUpdated` and `ItemTransferred` events .

![test-badge](https://github.com/ujwaldhakal/event-sourced-nestjs/workflows/test/badge.svg)

Initially i have implemented event store in relational database postgres. 
And eventually i will be moving the relation database implementation to Event Store database which is meant to be for event sourced application.

### Things to do
- Add Github Action Badge
- Manage warehouses
- Add User authentication
- Use event store DB 
- Add snapshot
